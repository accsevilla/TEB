Present
Once upon a time, there was a boy 
Who was named Julio Ricardo Montoya
He had three dogs and a small pig
But he was very hungry 
So he ate his pig
Julio LOVED bacon
But he decided he loves dogs more so he ate everything
This gave him a stomach ache :(
So he had to go to the hospital, but he had no car
So he called his friend Drake to take him to the hospital
